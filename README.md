This repository contains the work and projects completed during my internships at CodSoft. During my time at CodSoft, I worked on various projects that enhanced my skills in java development.
Number Game
The task involved developing a number-guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
I added some extra features to make it even more interesting:
Limited the number of attempts to guess the number, adding a challenging twist.
Included an option for multiple rounds, allowing players to enjoy the game repeatedly.
Implemented a scoring system based on the number of attempts or rounds won.

Sudent Grades
Marks Calculation and Grade Assignment System performs the following:
Input Collection: Takes the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Total Marks Calculation: Sums up the marks obtained across all subjects.
Average Percentage: Computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
Grade Assignment: Determines grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Results Display: Presents the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

ATM Interface
ATM Class Creation: Developed a class to represent the ATM machine with various functionalities.
User Interface Design: Designed a user-friendly interface for the ATM, including options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
Method Implementation: Implemented essential methods such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance() to manage transactions.
Bank Account Class: Created a class to represent the userâ€™s bank account, storing and managing the account balance.
Integration: Connected the ATM class with the bank account class to access and modify the account balance seamlessly.
Input Validation: Ensured robust input validation to maintain acceptable limits, such as checking for sufficient balance before withdrawals.
User Feedback: Displayed clear and informative messages based on user actions and transaction outcomes.

Student Management System
Student Class: Created a class to represent individual students with attributes such as name, roll number, and grade.
StudentManagementSystem Class: Implemented a class to manage a collection of students, including methods to add, remove, search for, and display student information.
Data Management: Integrated functionality to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or database.
Functionality: Enabled interactions to add new students, edit existing student information, search for specific students, and display all students in the system.
Input Validation: Implemented input validation to ensure that required fields are properly filled and data is in the correct format.
